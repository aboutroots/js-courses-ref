## ðŸš€ useState 

START:

You want to have an activated button or an inactivated button. And when the button is active it will display one piece of text like active and when is inactive it will display another piece of text like inactive. <br />

***SOLUTION:*** https://github.com/Had3r/Learning-Code/blob/master/react/reactHooks/useState-end/src/App.js

## ðŸš€ useState-2-end 

START:

1. Write an app where you're going to use a button to increment a numeric count.
Begin with a class based react component and then refactor that to a component with hook.
2.  Add two more buttons to your interface. The first button should have the text decrease and it should decrease the count by one. Another button with the text reset that is going to reset the count. <br />

***SOLUTION:*** https://github.com/Had3r/Learning-Code/blob/master/react/reactHooks/useState-2-end/src/App.js

## ðŸš€ useState-3-end 

START:

1. Build a basic form which is going to ask the user for their city and their country of residence.
And as the user fills out these two text input fields, you want to take that information the city and 
the country and display it on the page.
2. Use a plain javascript object to store the state.
3. Uther solution: invoke useState multiple times. <br />

***SOLUTION:*** https://github.com/Had3r/Learning-Code/blob/master/react/reactHooks/useState-3-end/src/App.js

## ðŸš€ useEffect 

START:

1. Output in the console the value of count state variable from the useEffect function body.
2. Output in the console the value of count state variable from teardown function.
3. Make the counter component visible and invisible (to simulate the process of mounting and unmounting. <br />
***Consider when exactly does React clean up an effect?*** <br />

***SOLUTION:*** https://github.com/Had3r/Learning-Code/blob/master/react/reactHooks/useEffect-mid/src/App.js

## ðŸš€ useEffect-mid

START:

4. Add a button that changes the color of the number.
5. Have your side effect to run only when a specific piece of state changes. <br />

***SOLUTION:*** https://github.com/Had3r/Learning-Code/blob/master/react/reactHooks/useEffect-end/src/App.js

## ðŸš€ simpleApp

START:

- Build an app where the user can type any lowercase letter or a space with their keyboard. 
- Then you want to take all the letters the user has type and output them to the screen in a fancy blog quote.
(so as the user presses characters they're going to see their text appear on the screen )
- you have to remember to tear down everything that you set up, so as not to broke the application <br />

***SOLUTION:*** https://github.com/Had3r/Learning-Code/blob/master/react/reactHooks/simpleApp-mid/src/App.js

MID: (custom hook)

- Let's say you wanted to build a second react component that has the exact same typing functionality
but a different UI. For example you want an H2 tag and a regular div instead of a blockquote. <br />

***SOLUTION:*** https://github.com/Had3r/Learning-Code/blob/master/react/reactHooks/simpleApp-end/src/App.js

## ðŸš€ useContext

START:

1. Create nested component structure so you can demonstrate how with context
you can pass information from the very top of the tree an app to button at the very bottom of the tree.
- with class components <br />

***SOLUTION:*** https://github.com/Had3r/Learning-Code/blob/master/react/reactHooks/useContext-mid/src/App.js

MID:

2. Refactor the work that you created into functional hooks based components. 
Introduce the useContext hook for creating a consumer to receive your context. <br />

***SOLUTION:*** https://github.com/Had3r/Learning-Code/blob/master/react/reactHooks/useContext-end/src/App.js
