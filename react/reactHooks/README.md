## ðŸš€ useState 

START:

You want to have an activated button or an inactivated button. And when the button is active it will display one piece of text like active and when is inactive it will display another piece of text like inactive. <br />

## ðŸš€ useState-2-end 

START:

1. Write an app where you're going to use a button to increment a numeric count.
Begin with a class based react component and then refactor that to a component with hook.
2.  Add two more buttons to your interface. The first button should have the text decrease and it should decrease the count by one. Another button with the text reset that is going to reset the count. <br />

## ðŸš€ useState-3-end 

START:

1. Build a basic form which is going to ask the user for their city and their country of residence.
And as the user fills out these two text input fields, you want to take that information the city and 
the country and display it on the page.
2. Use a plain javascript object to store the state.
3. Uther solution: invoke useState multiple times. <br />
