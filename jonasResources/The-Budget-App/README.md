# The Budget App Project   
> This App allows us to add incomes and expenses for a certain month. The App calculates, how much money we have made, and how much we spent, and then it gives us a total budget.

## General info

This project contains most of the things I've learned so far (objects and functions, lots of arrays, lots of DOM manipulation, and a bunch of other important stuff). I also learned how to approach and how to solve specific problems, and how to make all the pieces of a code fit together (structuring the code with modules).

## Technologies used
