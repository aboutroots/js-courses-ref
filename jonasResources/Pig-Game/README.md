# Pig-game            
> This is a simple game, that we can play in the browser.

## General info

The goal of this project is to better understand how events are processed, writing code according to the DRY Principle, and how to implement state variables.

## Technologies used
* HTML 
* CSS 
* JavaScript

## Game rules:

* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
* In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
* BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
